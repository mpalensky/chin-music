Chin Music
===========


Overview
---------

Sabermetrics provides new insights into baseball, but it can be difficult to
apply unfamiliar statistics to game situations.  Chin Music let's users view
advanced statistics as games progress.

For example, Chin Music can (will eventually ...) answer the following questions:

* My team has runners on first and second with no outs.  How many runs should I expect them to score?  If the batter bunts the runners to second and third, how does that change the expected score?

* My team has a three run lead in the third inning.  What are the odds they win?

* The manager changed up the batting order.  How does that change how many runs they'll score?


Chin Music will also provide:

* Bone-headed manager alerts - Be informed when a manager makes a terrible move
